# 1. Course overview

# 2. Why unit testing? why jasmine?
- Unit Testing - testing smallest testable code (i.e. function)
- Ensure changes don't break things
- Testable code is quality code
- Jasmine comes with everything out of the box to test your code

# 3. Important javascript notes!
- [const] and [let] will be used as variable declarations
- Ecmascript specification, es2015, es6
- [let] is scope to local block
- [const] are variables that cannot be reassigned
- [functions]
- [arrow functions] research about them
- [async] and [await] part of es2017 specification

CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD SECTION MATERIALS / SOURCE FILES
https://github.com/juanlizarazo/jasmine-casts/archive/1.0.zip

The materials are in a zip file, extract to your desired location. You will see the following file structure:

The start folder contains the source code in a complete state right before we start the section.

This is the folder you want to work on if you are coding along with me!

The section 2 is the only one that does not have a start folder as we start there from scratch.


The end folder contains the source code in a complete state right after we finish the section.

This is the folder you want to execute if you are watching the videos and just want to execute the complete code at the end of this section.

Additionally you can visit the github repository at:
